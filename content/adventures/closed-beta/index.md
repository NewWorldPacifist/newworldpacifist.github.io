4) Complete my professions information
5) Build a community

## Week 1 Results
The first week of closed beta was hectic! I ended up at level 36 with 35 hours played. On top of all this my leveling method was nerfed in a hot-fix Friday morning. Town Board Quests used to refresh every 5 minutes, but was changed a 30 minute refresh timer.

Lets get to the point. Pacifist characters are still possible in New World! Its actually a lot easier than it was from The Preview in 2020. It will still be a bit of a lengthy process for the average player. Not able to defend yourself and always running from combat takes away from you earning experience.

### Day 1 (Tuesday)
All about gathering resources and getting myself upgraded to the best tools I could get. Iron is minable at level 1, so I was able to get a full set of Iron Tools. Gear on the other hand was a bit too RNG for me to try and get a solid set going. End of the day I hit level 19 due to all the Town Board quests I was able to complete. For the Town Board Quests I did my best to have a mix of raw resources and refined resources in the Storage Shed.

### Day 2 (Wednesday)
A bit of a short day for me as I had to drive 6 hours that day. The focus for the day was to try and get gathering gear for all but skinning. I didn't want to have a skinning focused set of gear because its not an easy profession to focus on as a pacifist. This would also save me a little bag space. Most of the gear I ended up buying off the Trading Post for ok prices. Overall I would say it was a success as I was able to get 4/5 of my armor with bonus luck gathering perks. By the end of the day I was able to achieve level 23.

### Day 3 (Thursday)
The day focus was levels! Try to see how far I could level in one day. I ended on level 35 for a total of 12 levels. Not as big as my first day, however at higher levels more experience is needed to level. Overall more experience which means I feel it was successful when compared to Day 1.

### Day 4 (Friday)
Just play the game day. I just wanted to relax and try different things this day. There was a push for Starmetal tools, but was unable to achieve that due to my Engineering level not 100. Admittingly the Town Board Quest nerf bummed me out some cause I don't think I will be able to hit level 60 before the end of Closed Beta now. Still happy that a pacifist characters are a thing though!

#### Things Learned & Tricks

* Added water to your consumable slot and save on weight. (Carry 1000+)
* Azoth is really good for teleporting, but hard to obtain. 
* Loot yield is better than luck. 
* Yield > Azoth > Luck > Durability [Best Perk Order I think]
* 100 Points in Int for 5% Azoth chance isn't that good once you can get it.
* 100 Points in Con for 10% tool durability seems like the best stat bonus.
* Armor doesn't seem worth spending the gold on.
* Would rather just spend my repair kits on tools.
* Death teleporting is an okay way to teleport
* Use Jewelcrafting to gain repair kits. Salvaged items gives the gem back.
* Achievements show what you have and haven't killed.
* Includes party kills!
* Its possible to identify a pacifist character. 


## Week 2 Results
Second week of Closed Beta seemed just as crazy as the first week. Amazon Game Studios has a bit on their hands with server stability. In the end though I was able to reach level 60! 3 Days, 20 Hours, and 51 Minutes in game play time to achieve this. 

### Day 5 (Monday)
My focus was leveling as I was able to see level 60 in range before the end of the Closed Beta still. I also made this my Exploit Awareness Day for the stream. I showed off the town board reset quest exploit upon request to show that it is still active in the game and to provide the devs with more information about the bug. Since I was not doing the gathering 0 turn-in exploit, the only thing this exploit did for me was enable me to level faster with the extra resources I had. (~3 hours faster based on how many times I did it) Went from level 36 to level 42. I did play for about 12 hours this day...

### Day 6 (Tuesday)
Went back to grinding to get that sweat level 60. Obtained level 47 after a 10 hour play session. Decided to make the change from Windsware to Everfall for my questing hub. Everfall had 3 more quests for me to pick from since they were using all the upgrades they had access to while Windsward wouldn't do the quality of life upgrades. I also decided to test out Luck gear over the gathering luck gear to see if there was much of a difference. From a gathering view it doesn't appear to affect it so you will want gathering luck based on what you are gathering. 

### Day 7 (Wednesday)
One of my shorter 4 hour day. Reached level 49. Put some more thought into the gathering luck and I feel that the Harvesting luck is really the only one worth doing while leveling. Created a spreed sheet for crafting and item sources for the community. Harvesting things like Herbs with harvesting luck tends to yield more cooking ingredients than not. If you plan to open a lot of crates though, I strongly suggest luck to gear for that. Moved to Weaver's Fen to test experience rates over there and to not support the mega company on the server.

### Day 8 (Thursday)
Spent a little under 11 hours player this day. Ended on level 54. Amazon Game Studios patched the Town Board quests. The repeated turn-in is no longer and on top of this they adjusted the experience rates. I was worried that they would be nerfed, but they seem better since I was able to level faster than before. It could be anecdotal since I can see the end in sight, but I'll know for sure after I review past videos when I get a chance. Started to really feel the stress of playing the game for extended periods of time so I disabled my mic for the day. Moved over to Mourningdale for better experience rates since the mega company was willing to do upgrades over there for me. With the patch the higher level zones gave more experience than lower for crate gathering. 

### Day 9 (Friday)
Streamed for a total of 8 hours and reached level 57. Decided to keep my mic off to help me keep my sanity. My introvert side was really starting to take over. I was defiantly focused on reaching the end goal. Tested zone jumping to increase my xp rates for leveling. Seems to of done good. 

### Day 10 (Sunday)
With only 3 levels left I decided to take a break Saturday. Seems I needed just another 6 hours from the last time I played to reach level 60. The break really helped me focus and enabled me to do town boards from multiple locations. I jumped from Mourningdale/Windsward/Everfall to complete quests at a faster rate. Ending stats can be found in the screen shots next to this exert.

#### Ending Notes
* Azoth is more important than I made it out to be the first week. It would of really helped to have to make starmetal tools.
* Azoth would of helped to have for fast traveling to get more town board quests done.
* Harvesting Luck and Chest Luck are worth having while leveling. Logging Luck and Mining Luck set can be done after reaching level cap.
* Might as well just keep all my points in Con while leveling. Did branch out for Int/Str, but in the end Con is where it is at.
* Higher Con helps with higher level zones and keeping older gear if players aren't posting them for good prices. 
* Achievements are account side. If you want to make a pacifist character make sure you don't have an alt killing things. ;)
