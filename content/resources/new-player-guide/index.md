## New Player Guide
Welcome to my new player guide for New World! Here I will go over the basics to help you learn about the game and what you can do. This isn't focused on a pacifist character, but for anyone interested in New World. 

If you have any questions, feel free to join my Pacifist Discord and ask questions there!
![New Player Face](img/new-player-face.webp)

## Startup Menu
When you first launch New World and you log into the system you are greeted with the start-up menu. This area contains content updates (patch notes), forum links, and other information directly related to the game. Selecting a square will launch your default web browser and goto the related webpage.
![Main Menu](img/main-menu.webp)

## Character Screen
After selecting continue from the Startup Menu you are shown your character screen. Before you make your character, make sure you have your <span style="color:red">REGION</span> set correctly. (<span style="color:orange">US West</span>, <span style="color:green">US East</span>, <span style="color:slateblue">EU</span>, <span style="color:dodgerblue">Australia</span>, and <span style="color:purple">South America</span>) You want to select the best region based on your location for the best game play experience. After your region is correct you can select Create Character and figure out how you want to look in game!
![Char Select](img/char-select.webp)

## Character Creation
When creating a new character you have a bit of options to select to figure out the best character for your interest. You can select your body type (masculine or feminine), how your face looks, skin tone, hair style, facial hair, eye color, birth marks, scars, tattoos and the color of those tattoos. 

Finalize your character and give them a name. You can use spaces in your name so if you wanted a first name and surname you can! (Limited to 14 characters though)
![face04](img/face04.webp)

## Game Tutorial
Right after finalizing your character you are thrown into a cut scene and your tutorial starts. Players have the option to skip the tutorial in the menu once you can access it, however this is only suggested if you've already completed this once before. The tutorial is rather straight forward and teaches you the basics about the game. Attack, dodge, block, moving, inventory, equipping items, and weapon mastery. 
![tutorial](img/tutorial.webp)

## Spawning on the Beach
After the game tutorial is completed you wash up on the beach in one of four locations; Monarch's Bluffs, First Light, Everfall or Windsward. From here you are free to do whatever you want to your heart's content, however it is suggested to head to the closest outpost from where you spawned. Generally speaking it is directly in front of you, where you will find an NPC that will assist you with completing your Main Story Quest (MSQ). 
![spawning beech](img/spawning-beech.webp)

## General Overview
From here I will provide you with some general information that will assist your game play experience in the New World. Things like the leveling system, attributes, equipment, storage, professions, game mechanics, and more!

## Character Resource Bars
Your character uses 3 major resources; <span style="color:red">Health</span>, <span style="color:slateblue">Mana</span>, and <span style="color:yellow">Stamina</span>.

* <span style="color:red">Health</span>: White bar means full health otherwise it will show red. Reach 0 and you will enter <span style="color:orange">Death's Door</span>. Death's Door is where you are downed waiting for someone to pick you up. While down you have temporary hit points that slowly decrease. If that reaches 0 then your character dies and you have to respawn.
* <span style="color:slateblue">Mana</span>: A spell caster's resource to use magical spells. Full mana doesn't show while out of combat. Naturally recovers over 50 seconds. Can be completely ignored if you don't plan to play a spell caster. 
* <span style="color:yellow">Stamina</span>: A small yellow bar that appears above your health. It is used to Dodge, Block and throw weapons. Regenerates in 3 seconds. You can't regenerate stamina while blocking. Regeneration starts 1 second after an action that consumes stamina.
