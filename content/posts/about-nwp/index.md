Here you will learn about New World Pacifist and why it was created. 

## NewWorldPacifist.com
The idea for NewWorldPacifist.com first came to fruition around the release of the New World Preview in 2020 when players had their first chance to publically play New World by Amazon Games. On [November 25th 2020](https://youtu.be/I-R5oPc6ndg), I played around with the idea of a pacifist character and was curious to everything I was able to do in this MMO without dealing any kind of damage. 

## But, Why?
Simply put, I like a good challenge in video games. This includes playing in ways that the game doesn't intend for you to play. For example; I've completed The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past without using the sword. 

I've played other games whereas pacifist options were included in the game and they've proved to be a fun experience for me. The first game I've completed as a pacifist character is called [Iji](/pacifistgames/iji) and the second one was [Undertale](https://undertale.com/). 

Finally, I have had any conversations from other games as to why classifies as a pacifist game and what doesn't. If we take the [Merriam-Webster definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pacifist); "Someone who opposes war or violence as a means of settling disputes." - This means the person will still commit an act of violence if it's necessary, however is strongly opposed to doing so and will try every other method before doing so.(At least, that's what I think.) So I've decided to break down the types of pacifist playthroughs a player can have under [What is a Pacifist](/posts/what-is-a-pacifist) section of this website and explain it all there.
