Here you will learn the importance of how MMOs change the way of a Pacifist Character.

## MMOs & Updating
It's common for MMOs to update and balance/change gameplay. Every MMO has to create new content for their players and to give them a reason to keep playing. Every MMO approaches this differently and tend to focus on the major crowd over the niche players. It's due to this that sometimes Pacifist Players get punished for things outside of their control. For example; New World [patch 1.0.5](https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/new-world-update-1-0-5?) changed the requirements to access the Trading Post making it impossible for a Pacifist Player to use the Trading Post anymore. 

When World of Warcraft first released, you didn't gain experience for gathering professions. However over the course of time and the release of [Mist of Pandaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Mists_of_Pandaria), players were able to reach level cap without killing by gathering only! 


## MMO Tags
When reviewing a game on NewWorldPacifist.com, I will make sure to mention that the game is an MMO and what version of the game I was playing at the time of review.

Please make sure to check the version to know how old the content is. Thus, you can make an educated decision to play the game or not.
